Jasper Server Notes:


generateReport = 
This service will generate a pdf report and returns a tokenid. The report is stored in the output report path at /apps/server/output/. 


Paths:
reportOutputPath = where the generated reports will be saved. Usually at /apps/server/output/

templatePath = where the reports are located. The template must include the module name i.e. obo/electricalpermit.jasper. Usually the reports located here are provided by the system (default reports).

customPath = custom reports provided by the user. The system will locate folders from this folder first before the templatePath. To override a report from the template, name the report exactly as that in the template 

The report service will need the ff. parameters:

- 1. reportid = will be used by the interceptor
- 2. modulename = will determine the folder where the report templates are located. This also coincides with the module's name
- 3. template = the name of the report template. This must already be the compiled version or that ends in .jasper
- 4. org = only specified when the report server is deployed in the cloud.

A simple example.

If URL = localhost:XXX/osiris3/json/enterprise/JasperReportService.generateReport?modulename=obo&reportid=electricalpermit 

Interceptor as follows:


@Service("Obo")

@Before( pattern="JasperReportService.generateReport", eval="#{ args[0].modulename = 'obo' 
	&& args[0].reportid.matches('electricalpermit') }"  )
public void generateReport( def evt ) {
	def args = evt.args[0];




	args.template = args[0].reportid + ".jasper";
}
